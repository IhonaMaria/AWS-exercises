# AWS-exercises

The aim of this repository is to provide content and exercises I have developed to understand and learn more about Amazon Web Services. 
The exercises are well-detailed and can be easily followed and replicated.

The exercises explore these services:

- s3 and lambda
- EC2
- ECR
- RDS
- VPC (and networking associated)
- EMR
- Dynamo DB
- AWS Glue
